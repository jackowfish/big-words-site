    <h3>Team Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If a team member must miss a scheduled meeting, they should notify all teammates 24 hours prior to the meeting. In addition, if the meeting is with a client or mentor, they should also notify them 24 hours in advance. If more than one teammate cannot attend a meeting, rescheduling the meeting will be discussed.</li>
        <li>Team members should communicate frequently in the BigWords group chat and keep their progress up to date on the groupâ€™s Trello board so other teammates know the status of each designated task.</li>
        <li>Be clear with variable names used while coding and make sure to comment frequently so other group members, clients, and future programmers can understand what the code is doing. </li>
        <li>For git collaboration, we will use a centralized git workflow. Feature branches will be created if needed. When someone is going to push a big commit, they can message in the BigWords group chat to let other group members know.</li>
    </ul>
    Note: All team rules are subject to change throughout the course of the semester with approval from all team members.
