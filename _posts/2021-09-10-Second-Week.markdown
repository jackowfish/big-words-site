This week we didn't have a meeting with our client because of labor day (our scheduled meeting date is Monday). However, we compiled [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov7yP3klnG3QNDZsezzty-ws3iLQHAU7FfO4nqLQJB8/edit) through email and asked for her feedback on the various goals we had for the application. She gave us the okay, and we started writing user stories.

We also had a mentor meeting, where we went over the website we had created, and our mentor gave us advice on writing user stories and for creating our wireframe going forward. Overall productive week.
