The product management approach our team uses is a Kanban style [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/44ptFkKT/kanban-board).

This board is split into 6 sections:

1. **Secondary / Research:**

   This section mainly focuses on things that may be outside our current scope, but we'd like to look into if we have time. If someone finds that any of these are worth looking into, the tickets can be extended upon and put into our main backlog to review as a team.

2. **Priority Backlog**

   This section focuses on items that need to be done, but their timelines are further ahead than a week, and the team has decided that they aren't the main focus of the current deadline. The team will decide weekly what is most important to accomplish before the next monday and move those tasks over to "To Do".

3. **To Do**

   This section focuses on things that are due in the current deadline and need to be finished soon. These tasks are picked up throughout the week by team members and moved into "WIP". *If it's towards the end of the week and the "To Do" column is still full, that probably means we're behind schedule.*

4. **WIP**

   These are tickets are currently being worked on by team members, hence "Work in Progress". You assign the ticket to yourself when moving it to this column.

5. **Pending**

   Tickets that need to be reviewed by a client, i.e. big UX changes, or blocked by someone else's work, are put into pending. These issues will be resolved throughout the week by communication between team members and communication with the client.

6. **Done**

   These tickets have been completed. We are able to see who has finished the task because they assign the ticket themselves when they move it to the "WIP" column.
