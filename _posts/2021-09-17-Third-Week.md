This week we began our first draft of our clickable prototype.  Before starting our own design, we first examined the [already existing prototype created by our client’s daughter](https://framer.com/projects/BigWordsWireframes--4ZppLRh7YOHdUekj7i0L-cR90L?utm_source=iterable) to get a feel of what they were looking for.  We also elected to first design how the application will look on a phone screen rather than the laptop/computer screen seen above, as the primary way of accessing the app will be through a caretaker’s phone.  During our mentor meeting this week, we showed our mentor our work-in-progress prototype.  We received helpful feedback and design tips going forward.

At our client meeting this week, we presented our “finished” draft and worked with our client and her daughter to gain a better understanding of how they envision the final product to look, feel, and function.  Feedback from this meeting can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mW053XBo648DJ40ZNsKeO17EeD8Vy6GlM4noXBamHbo/edit?usp=sharing).  As we progress through the semester, we will continue to update our prototype in correspondence with our client.
