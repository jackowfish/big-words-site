Had our first meetings with our client and mentor this week!

Our client, Jennifer, has a daughter Emma who has an existing codebase we can use as a reference for this project linked [here](https://github.com/EmmaElizStone/BigWords). She also shared with us some logo ideas for BigWords linked [here](https://notability.com/n/1~Ij8kGO_BsAX). We talked about basic neccessities for the application such as:

- Profile / Login functionality
- Access to either her current book database (which she hand transcribes) or access to an existing book API to track word exposure for children
- Automatic data crunching for word exposure so individuals can track their children's progress
- Link books in the database by their "big words" - if one book has the word "toucan," then show other books that have that word too

A big wishlist item of hers is to allow clients to contact her quickly to add books to the database, possibly with voice memo function of them reading it (possible Otter.ai integration here).

Our meeting with our mentor went awesome as well. We had a good "get to know you" session where we just discussed our backgrounds and our experience in software engineering.
