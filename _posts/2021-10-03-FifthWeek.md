	This week we solidified the overall architecture and technologies we will use while developing BigWords.  When discussing the possible languages, frameworks, and data management systems we could use for this project, we thoroughly considered each potential option before coming to our final conclusion.  By working on this assignment, we were able to critically think about the features we want to create and what we can use to implement them.  During our mentor meeting this week, we discussed the different ways we could set up our database.  Our main issues were: determining how books were stored within Firestore, how these book entries would interact with each other, and how users would be able to access book data.  With our mentorâ€™s help we were able to resolve these questions and began work on our architecture diagram.
    
	While working on the architecture diagram, we gained a better understanding of how our users, front-end, back-end, and database should interact with each other.  In addition to creating a way for our mentor and client to understand our system at a high level, we now have a reference guide as to how input and data should flow to refer back to while developing BigWords.
