This week, we took a moment to reflect on the service aspect of BigWords while completing the APPLES Reflection 1 assignment.  In this reflection, we discussed the importance of the need we are meeting by working on this project as well as how our work will impact the implementation of BigWords as a whole.
We also continued to [update our prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/nN1gq71nBpwzmpAneMNd2s/Prototype-v3?node-id=5%3A4225&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=5%3A4225) based on the client feedback we received last week.  We also began to play with the color scheme of our application [based on a color palette provided by our client](https://coolors.co/ee6352-ffc857-06d6a0-153b50-5e6472).

At our mentor meeting this week, we presented our completed prototypes and discussed what we had learned while working on it.  Our main takeaway from this assignment was understanding the importance of communicating with our client and understanding what theyâ€™re asking for and what they mean.  We also began creating our plan of action going forward.  This included discussing our application architecture and diagram as well as creating the github repository for our walking skeleton.
