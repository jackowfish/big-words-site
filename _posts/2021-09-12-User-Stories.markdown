We used [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ov7yP3klnG3QNDZsezzty-ws3iLQHAU7FfO4nqLQJB8/edit) created in collaboration with our client to write the following user stories, organized into categories 'need-to-have' and 'nice-to-have'.

**Need-to-have**

* As a caregiver, in order to start tracking my children’s words, I can create an account and input personalized information like date of birth and name for both caregivers and children. I can also authenticate multiple caregivers and children on the same account.
* As a caregiver, in order to personalize my account, I can always add/edit/remove caregivers and children, as well as any relevant information. I can also change my password when needed.
* As a caregiver, in order to organize books I have read to my children, I can indicate which caregiver read each book and to which children.
* As a caregiver, in order to find books to read to my children, I can search for books within the database based on title and specific words/big words.
* As a caregiver, in order to keep track of books I have read to my children, I can access a list of books I have logged and see how many times I have read it and the words each book contains. I can also see books that contain similar words to those books I have read.
* As a caregiver, in order to save books that aren’t already included in the app, I can fill out a form with the title, author, and/or picture of the book. Once the form is submitted, a BigWords admin will be notified to add the book to the database.
* As a caregiver, in order to track my children’s exposure to words, I can view the words and big words my child has been exposed to in a personalized dictionary.
* As a caregiver, in order to gain more knowledge about preparing for a child’s future and the benefits of reading to them, I can access various relevant articles.
* As a caregiver, in order to notify BigWords of any issues with the app, I can fill out a form that will be sent to the BigWords team.

**Nice-to-have**

* As a caregiver, in order to further personalize my account, I can change the theme, icon, etc. of my account.
* As a caregiver, in order to plan what books and when to read to my child, I can add books to a reading list and also locate certain books (online options, local library availability, etc.).
* As a caregiver, in order to further understand the words my children have been exposed to, I can sort my personalized dictionary by different criteria.
* As a caregiver, in order to organize books I want to read to my children, I can save favorite books in a list. I can also see a reading list auto-curated based on books and words already read.
* As a caregiver, in order to help other caregivers using Big Words choose books to read to their children, I can leave reviews of books.
* As a caregiver, in order to save books that aren’t already included in the app, I can still log the book by reading it aloud and have it transcribed in-app.
