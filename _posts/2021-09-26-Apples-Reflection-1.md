​	Reading to children during early childhood has been proven to be a pivotal factor in children's skill-building. Billions of dollars are spent to remediate the 'skills gaps' in our education systems, but these gaps could be easily prevented through daily read-aloud practices during the first few years of a child's life. BigWords was created to help eliminate these gaps and provide caregivers with a tool to visualize their child's exposure to words.

​	Caregivers need a tool to help focus on one thing science shows children's brains need most: words. There are few, if any, applications that provide caregivers with the ability to track children's books and words and naturally grow their vocabulary. Technology in this field is falling behind the times; physicians and pediatricians have yet to digitize the paper book logs given to parents over the past 30 years. BigWords meets this need by providing caregivers with a web application to receive feedback on the quantity and quality of words children hear in storybook reading, and for children and caregivers alike to track books that have been read over time. Additionally, BigWords provides personalized word-based book recommendations to keep the list of exposed words expanding over time. Working on this application, we are helping our client achieve their goal of building a better future and growing the innovators of tomorrow.
